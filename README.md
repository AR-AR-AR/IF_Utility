# IF_Utility
Utility that uses InfiniteFlight Connect API to interface with Infinite Flight.


## Project Descriptions
1. **IF_Utility**: 
This is the main project. It consists mostly of the main window and some basic UserControls.
2. **IFConnect**:
This project contains the interfaces for communicating with the IFConnect API and datatypes for deserializing JSON data.
3. **FlightPlanDatabase**:
This contains some interfaces for FlightPlanDatabase.com API. Simple flight plan datatypes and logic implemented so far to search for flight plans.
4. **Indicators**:
Work in progress. Started with an attitude indicator that still needs some refinement. 
Wanted to use an image as the background scale but can't get it to position correctly to match pitch.
